# Rploce - Escape's fullstack software engineering interview

## Description

You are developing a clone of the [r/place](https://www.reddit.com/r/place/) reddit event place.

You have been assigned the following business requirements:

- People can visit a web page, select a pixel on a canvas, and attach a color to that pixel on the canvas.
- Assigning a color is a rate-limited operation, it can happen once every x minutes for a given IP.
- When browsing the page, you see on each pixel of the canvas the last color that was assigned to it.

## Assessment

We ask you to provide **clean, idiomatic and formatted code**, as well as a **clean git history**. These elements **will be part of the assessment**.

We ask you to provide **pragmatic** solutions to meet the below requirements:

- For instance, solving this test and matching our business requirements does not require to setup a database system.
- You should focus on solutions working **locally**, without worrying about moving it to any kind of production environment.

You can include the libraries you need to deliver the required features, but we ask you to stick with the chosen libraries for the test, as this test is designed to have you showcase your skills in web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JS).

## Delivery

You can submit your work in these two different ways

1. Invite us to a **private** repository holding your source code. **Public forks of the base rploce repository are forbidden (for obvious reasons) and will not be reviewed.**
2. Send us an archive containing your workplace folder, **including the .git folder**

## Exercises

- You have to complete exercise 1 first, but exercises 2, 3, and 4 can be completed independently.
- For each exercise, the estimated of time to spend on it is indicated.

### Exercise 1: A basic collaborative canvas (40min)

The first step requires you to modify the existing codebase to provide a basic interactive canvas:

- It is possible to chose the color of cells in the canvas
- The color of the cell should be persisted and survive a server restart
- The color selected for the canvas' cell should be displayed in the website
- No need to provide rate-limiting
- No need to provide server-side authentication

## Exercise 2: Improvements on the application (40min)

- It is possible to update the color of tile without using the mouse
  _Hint: It might be required to still leverage the mouse for selecting a color in the native color picker input_
- The frontend display is a bit less ugly, and color transitions are animated
- It is possible to leverage external libraries to achieve this result

## Exercise 3: Improvements on the server (1h40min)

- With two windows opened, if I update the color of a tile on the first window, I should see the change reflected in the second window with any page reload
- It is possible to leverage external libraries to achieve this result
- No need to provide authentication
- _Bonus_: Rate limiting is implemented

If you decide to leverage websockets, we provide the following code for accepting a websocket connection on the server side, using [socket.io](https://socket.io/)

```ts
import { App } from "uWebSockets.js"; # yarn add uNetworking/uWebSockets.js#v20.30.0
import { Server } from "socket.io";

const io = new Server();

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
  console.log("received connection");
  socket.emit("hello", "world");
});

// Make sure to create a different app than the API's app
const wss = App();
io.attachApp(wss);

wss.listen(3004, () => {
  console.info(`WSS is listening on http://localhost:3004`);
});
```

If you decide to leverage server sent events, your server can return event-stream responses like so:

```ts
router.route({
  path: CANVAS_PATH,
  method: "GET",
  schemas: {
    responses: {
      200: {
        type: "string",
      } as const,
    },
  },
  handler() {
    // FeTS' `Response` does not allow to return anything else than a plain object, because it is a proxy.
    // See https://github.com/ardatan/feTS/blob/7334d3086ec95dcd69cadc2be0b6447087a0696e/packages/fets/src/Response.ts#L80
    return new globalThis.Response(
      new ReadableStream({
        async start(controller) {
          while (true) {
            controller.enqueue(
              "data: " + new Date().toISOString() + "\r\n\r\n"
            );
            await setTimeout(1000);
          }
        },
      }),
      {
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "text/event-stream",
          Connection: "keep-alive",
          "Cache-Control": "no-cache",
        },
      }
    );
  },
});
```
